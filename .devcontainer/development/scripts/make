# Script to manage building and deploying the openosp emr www application to Tomcat
# This script supports the following operations:
# - clean: Cleans the project and removes the deployed www app from Tomcat.
# - install: Builds the project and deploys it to Tomcat. Optionally, you can run tests by passing --run-tests.

# SCRIPT_DIR will hold the directory where this script is located.
# This is useful because you may run the script from a different directory,
# but we want to ensure that the relative paths (like the server script) always work correctly.
